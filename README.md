# UOA Badminton Club Website
Project initiated by WDCC in 2023.

## About

**2025:** We are focused on creating a functional website for the University of Auckland Badminton Club. The functional website will comprise a membership process (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out), membership management system, court booking process and more. The website will be built to be user-friendly, aesthetic alongside having an effective and efficient back-end to satisfy the clients.

## Setting up the project

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js installation

The first thing you must do is install `Node.js` so you can access the `pnpm` package manager.

**Volta (Recommended)**

It is recommended to use [`Volta`](https://volta.sh/) to manage the Node.js version.

Follow the [instructions](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) on the website to install it.

**nvm (Node Version Manager)**
However if you are having problems or do not want to use `Volta` it is also advisable to use `nvm` to manage the Node.js
version.

- [Windows installation](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
- [UNIX](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)

In the same directory as this `README.md` file, run the following command to install the correct version of Node.js:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

### Running the project

#### Using pnpm

If you complete one of the above steps you can install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

Once `pnpm install` has finished, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The development server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Keeping a clean codebase

We rely the plugins [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/) and [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/docs/) to keep
the codebase clean and consistent. It is optional to use these plugins locally but your code will be checked against
them when you make a pull request.

#### IDE Setup

If you are using `VSCode` some extensions will be recommended to you.

[Open the extensions panel and find recommended ones](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace)
Otherwise you are responsible for figuring out how to configure those plugins in your IDE. (Most IDEs
like [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [Zed](https://zed.dev/) have plugins for these tools built in).

#### Documentation

We recommend that everyone uses the [`JSDoc`](https://jsdoc.app/) syntax to document their code. This will help other
developers more easily understand the function of code, as names can be misleading. For example:

```ts
/**
 * Adds two numbers together
 * @param {number} a - The first number
 * @param {number} b - The second number
 * @returns {number} The sum of the two numbers
 */
export const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b
```

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to store sensitive information that should not be stored in the codebase. These are stored in a `.env` file in the root of the project.

Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

### Type Generation

We use payload's built in code generation to generate types for our project. To do this you can run the following command:

```bash
pnpm generate:types
```

### Automated Testing

Automated testing is an important part of writing code that can be maintained and understood long after the developers
stop working on code.

We use [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/guide/why.html) as our test runner because of its ease of setup

Tests should be prefixed with the extension `*.test.ts|x`, for example `adder.ts` would have a test file called
`adder.test.ts`.

To run all the tests the following command can be used

```bash
pnpm test
```

To run a single test you can use the following command

```bash
# src/app/example-double-admin-count/route.ts can be any file path that points to a test.
# Or you can replace the file path with a pattern (like a file name)
pnpm test src/app/example-double-admin-count/route.test.ts
```

## Tech Stack

The project is _mainly_ built around the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
    - The main framework for this project, it is most important to understand that we are using
      the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)
      and [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) to build the
      project. Note that you will need to have some understanding of [React](https://react.dev/learn) to work on this
      project.
- [PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/)
    - We are using PayloadCMS to manage the content of the website, as well as define the shape of our data. This takes
      away a lot of the hard work that is put into setting up a database and API. You will have to familiarise yourself
      with how to use Payload's [local API](https://payloadcms.com/docs/local-api/overview).

Additional information is to be documented on the [wiki](https://github.com/UoaWDCC/uabc-web/wiki) for some of the
smaller dependencies
